                <p>Instructions</p>

                <h4>STEP 1</h4>
                <p>Cut the stem and leaf ends of the lemongrass. Peel off a few layers to reach the white part. Cut into 2-inch lengths and pound with the back of a knife to release flavor. Set aside.</p>

                <h4>STEP 2</h4>
                <p>Heat oil in a pot over medium heat. Add onions, garlic, and ginger. Cook until softened.</p>

                <h4>STEP 3</h4>
                <p>Add chicken and cook until its color changes and juices run clear.</p>

                <h4>STEP 4</h4>
                <p>Stir in fish sauce and cook for about 1 minute.</p>

                <h4>STEP 5</h4>
                <p>Pour in coconut juice and bring to a boil, skimming off any scum that may float on top.</p>

                <h4>STEP 6</h4>
                <p>Add the pounded lemongrass.</p>

                <h4>STEP 7</h4>
                <p>Lower the heat, cover, and continue cooking for about 20 to 25 minutes or until the chicken is thoroughly cooked.</p>

                <h4>STEP 8</h4>
                <p>Introduce papaya and cook for about 3 to 5 minutes or until it becomes tender.</p>

                <h4>STEP 9</h4>
                <p>Add coconut meat and cook until heated through.</p>

                <h4>STEP 10</h4>
                <p>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

                <h4>STEP 11</h4>
                <p>Add spinach leaves, pushing them down into the broth. Turn off the heat, cover the pot, and serve the dish hot.</p>
