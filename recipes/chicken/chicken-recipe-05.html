                <p>Instructions</p>

                <h4>STEP 1</h4>
                <p>In a pan over medium heat, heat oil.</p>
                
                <h4>STEP 2</h4>
                <p>Add potatoes and carrots. Cook, turning once or twice, until lightly browned. Remove from pan and drain on paper towels.</p>
                
                <h4>STEP 3</h4>
                <p>Remove excess oil from the pan, leaving about 2 tablespoons.</p>
                
                <h4>STEP 4</h4>
                <p>Add bell peppers and cook for about 30 to 45 seconds. Remove from pan and drain on paper towels.</p>
                
                <h4>STEP 5</h4>
                <p>Add onions and garlic. Cook until softened.</p>
                
                <h4>STEP 6</h4>
                <p>Add chicken. Cook, turning on sides once or twice, until lightly browned but not fully cooked through.</p>
                
                <h4>STEP 7</h4>
                <p>Add tomatoes. Cook, mashing regularly with the back of a spoon until softened and releasing juices.</p>
                
                <h4>STEP 8</h4>
                <p>Add fish sauce. Cook for about 1 to 2 minutes.</p>
                
                <h4>STEP 9</h4>
                <p>Add water and bring to a boil.</p>
                
                <h4>STEP 10</h4>
                <p>Lower the heat, cover, and cook for about 20 to 30 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce is thickened to the desired consistency.</p>
                
                <h4>STEP 11</h4>
                <p>Add potatoes and carrots. Continue to cook until fork-tender.</p>
                
                <h4>STEP 12</h4>
                <p>Add bell peppers and sweet peas. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes or until green peas are heated through and bell peppers are tender yet crisp.</p>
                
                <h4>STEP 13</h4>
                <p>Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve hot.</p>
