                <p>Instructions</p>

                <h4>STEP 1</h4>
                <p>Sort through the mung beans, discarding discolored or shriveled beans and any grit or dirt. Rinse beans in cold, running water until water runs clear. Drain well.</p>
                <p>In a large pot, combine mung beans and water. Over medium heat, bring to a boil skimming froth that floats on top.</p>
                
                <h4>STEP 2</h4>
                <p>Lower heat, cover, and continue to cook for about 45 to 50 minutes or until beans have softened and skins have burst. Add more water as needed to maintain about 4 cups.</p>
                <p>In another pot over medium heat, heat oil. Add onions and garlic and cook until tender and aromatic.</p>
                
                <h4>STEP 3</h4>
                <p>Add tomatoes and cook, mashing with the back of the spoon, until softened. Add fish sauce and continue to cook for about 1 to 2 minutes. Add cooked mung beans including liquid. Bring to a boil.</p>
                
                <h4>STEP 4</h4>
                <p>Add pork cracklings and continue to cook until softened. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Add spinach, turn off heat and cover pot for about 1 to 2 minutes or until spinach is just wilted. Serve hot.</p>
